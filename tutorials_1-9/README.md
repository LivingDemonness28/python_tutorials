            <p>PS: We won’t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places</p>

            <p>The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest given on Wikipedia as</p>
            $$A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$

                <li>$P =$ principal amount(initial investment)</li>
                <li>$r =$ annual nominal interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
                <li>$n =$ number of times the interest is compounded per year</li>
                <li>$t =$ number of years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of $\$10000$ to variable $P$, assign to $n$ the value $12$, and assign to $r$ the interest rate of $8\%$. Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years $t$ that the money will be compunded for. Calculate ans print the final amount after $t$ years.</p>

                <li>You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go off in 51 hours. At what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you could count on your fingers, but this is not what we’re after. If you are tempted to count on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.)</li>
                <li>Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and ask for the number of hours to wait. Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes of</li>
